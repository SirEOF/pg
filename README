== Summary

This is the extension library to access a PostgreSQL database from Ruby. This
library works with PostgreSQL 7.4 and later.

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later.
* PostgreSQL 7.3 or later installed.

It may work with earlier versions as well, but those are not regularly tested.

== How to install ?

Install via RubyGems:

  gem install pg

Or follow the instructions below to compile and install:

  rake install

You may need to specify the path to the 'pg_config' program installed with
Postgres:

    --with-pgsql-include=<include file directory>
    --with-pgsql-lib=<library directory>

For example:

  rake --with-pgsql-include=/usr/local/pgsql/include \
                  --with-pgsql-lib=/usr/local/pgsql/lib

See the included RDoc documentation for more installation help.

== Acknowledgments

We are thankful to the people at the ruby-list and ruby-dev mailing lists.
And to the people who developed PostgreSQL.
